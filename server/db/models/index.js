 * I'd like to use the cache that's set up below (which isn't being used currently)
 * in a different way: to cache every comparison we've made between two activities
 * i.e. the table would look like "act1 | act2 | match (t/f)"
 *
 * What I'd like to know are a couple things:
 * 1. How to best set up this relationship with Sequelize/Postgres
 * 2. How to best query for matches when we're doing comparisons. This seems
 *    straightforward enough, but I want to avoid a situation where we have rows
 *    of both "34 | 56 | true" and "56 | 34 | true" if that makes sense.
 *
 * It seems reasonable (to me) that we should be storing the results of those comparisons,
 * as a database lookup would definitely be quicker than the comparison function
 * when it runs every test.
